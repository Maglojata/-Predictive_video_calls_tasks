Enhance a simple form with "Name" and "Email" fields by adding client-side validation that checks for non-empty inputs and a valid email format.

Skills: HTML for form structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for regex-based email validation and empty field checks.

JavaScript Focus: Use addEventListener for the form's submit event, prevent default action if validation fails, and display error messages next to the respective fields.
